# Advent of Code 2021

An attempt for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

* Note that this is based off my earlier attempt at the AoC 2019.
* This was an attempt to begin to use Kotlin's Arrow library.
* Thus, there is old code in the `old` directory that is outdated, but being kept for legacy purposes.
